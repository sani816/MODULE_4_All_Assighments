## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)
Frontend is the visible part of a web application that users directly interact with.

### **User Interface (UI)**
- Displays layout, colors, typography, buttons, forms, images, and content.
- Ensures the design looks clean, responsive, and visually appealing.

### **User Interaction (UX)**
- Handles clicks, typing, animations, and navigation.
- Ensures smooth experience using JavaScript and UI frameworks.

### **Communication With Backend**
- Sends API requests (like login, fetch data, submit forms).
- Receives responses from backend and updates UI accordingly.
- Uses fetch, Axios, or built‑in browser APIs.

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)
Backend runs on the server and powers all core functions of a web application.

### **Server-side Processing**
- Handles logic that users should not see.
- Processes API requests (login, calculations, form handling).

### **Database Handling**
- Stores and retrieves data.
- Manages users, orders, products, posts, transactions, etc.

### **Security and Authentication**
- Validates users with passwords, tokens, or sessions.
- Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- Applies role-based permissions.

## Q3. Business Logic
**Business Logic** refers to the rules and decision-making that define how a system should behave.

It controls how data is processed, validated, and transformed before being stored or shown to the user.

### **Examples:**
1. **E-commerce Checkout**
   - Applying discount rules
   - Calculating tax and shipping

2. **Banking App**
   - Preventing withdrawal if balance is insufficient
   - Adding interest to savings accounts

3. **School Management System**
   - Automatically generating student report cards
   - Restricting marks beyond a fixed limit

## Q4. Client–Server Model
A structure where two main components communicate with each other.

### **Client**
- The browser or app used by the user.
- Sends requests to the server.

### **Server**
- The machine that processes requests and sends back data.

### **How They Communicate**
1. Client sends a request (HTTP/HTTPS).
2. Server receives and processes it.
3. Server sends a response (data, HTML, JSON).
4. Client displays the results.

## Q5. Three-Tier Architecture
A method of organizing web applications into three separate layers.

### **1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
- Handles UI and user interaction.
- Written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### **2. Application (Business) Layer**
- Contains backend logic.
- Processes requests, applies rules, manages operations.

### **3. Data Layer (Database)**
- Stores and retrieves information.
- Examples: MySQL, MongoDB.

### **Why This Architecture Is Used**
- Makes apps scalable and maintainable.
- Each layer can be updated independently.
- Improves security and performance.

## Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language
JavaScript can run on servers using Node.js.

### **Performance**
- Fast execution due to V8 engine.
- Non-blocking I/O makes it suitable for real-time apps.

### **Ecosystem**
- Huge package library (npm).
- Support for APIs, authentication, databases, and more.

### **Popular Backend Frameworks**
- **Express.js** – lightweight and widely used.
- **NestJS** – structured and enterprise ready.
- **Fastify** – high-performance alternative.
